# Malware Detection using MLP Classifier
## Overview
This project aims to detect malware using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier. The classifier is trained on features extracted from malware samples and benign files to distinguish between the two classes. The MLP classifier achieves an impressive accuracy of 98.6%, making it a robust tool for malware detection.

### Key Features
= Utilizes an MLP classifier for malware detection.

= Achieves a high accuracy of 98.6%.

= Extracts features from both malware samples and benign files.

= Provides a reliable method for distinguishing between malicious and non-malicious files.
### Usage
Data Preparation: Ensure that the dataset containing malware samples and benign files is properly formatted and labeled.

Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the dataset using appropriate techniques.

Training: Train the MLP classifier using the extracted features and labeled data.

Testing: Evaluate the trained classifier on a separate test set to measure its accuracy.

Deployment: Once satisfied with the accuracy, deploy the classifier for real-world malware detection tasks.
### Requirements
Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
